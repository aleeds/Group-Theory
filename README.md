# Whiteheads Algorithm and Geometric Group Theory

This library was created for use in understanding and working with Free Group
automorphisms, in conjunction with ***INSERT PAPER NAME HERE***, a paper published in...

In the study of groups, the most fascinating of groups are the finitely
generated groups. These groups are the ones that are *tractable*, both from an
human mind perspective, and from a computer perspective. They are groups that
have a finite structure, but they do not need to be finite.

The simplest (from one perspective) of these groups are the so called Free Groups.
They are groups that have no restrictions, and you can think of them as being
generalizations of the Integers crossed with them selves multiple times, but
where addition is not commutative, ie *1 + 2* does not equal *2 + 1*. This
simple difference has a profound impact, and turns the free groups into groups
that contain copies of themselves, and copies of versions of themselves that are
significantly larger.

This library works on free groups. It provides several functionalities.

1. It implements Whiteheads algorithm, for determining if two lists of words
have an automorphism that goes from one to the other.
2. It implements Whitehead Graph drawing, a helpful tool to the mathematician.
3. It will implement some algorithms I developed for my paper.
4. I will attempt to encode some proofs into algorithms, as they are
constructive proofs.

Here, I will add instructions on how to download the library, and get it running.
